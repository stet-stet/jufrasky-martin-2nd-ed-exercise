# jufrasky-martin-2nd-ed-exercise

My answers for exercises in "Speech and Language Processing" by D. Jufrasky and J. H. Martin, 2nd ed.
*Yes, I do know that there is a 3rd version, but I prefer paper books.*

## Structure
 * Root - has folders with unit number(eg. 02) and name(eg. RegEx and Automata)
 * In the folders - for example, 2.1.py\/cpp\/txt\/whatever contains my answers to the exercises.

## Rules(not hard-enforced)
 * Do NOT use JS, use Python 3.7 or C++.
 * Whenever possible, delve into new language features.
 * If you don't have finals or midterm that week, do at least 2.5 chapters a week.
 * As always: "information alone is not enough; we also need the meaning of that information."
