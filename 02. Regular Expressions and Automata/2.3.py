# complete the FSA for English money expressions in Fig 2. 15 as suggested in the text following the figure.
# you should handle amounts up to $100000, 
# # and make sure that cent and dollar have the proper plural endings when appropriate.

# I know that regex and FSA are supposed to be the same
# but I guess Ill just post a png image or something later.
# or code in c++.

# 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 too.

# I can't knit, so 2.7 will be skipped as well.
