10. Give an algorithm for negating a deterministic FSA.

Algorithm: Make all states that are end-states non-end-states. Make all non-end-states(including the sink state) an end-state.

11. Why doesn't your previous algorithm work with NFSAs? Now extend your algorithm to negate an NFSA.

Why it does not work:
Check via NFSA succeeds if there exists a possibility that a check may succeed.
If we apply the algorithm outlined in Question 10, 
all strings that partly pass will not be properly negated, because
after flipping states as outlined above, there is still chance that a check may succeed.

To properly negate it, the easiest algorithm to come to mind would be:
1. Turn the NFSA into an DFSA.
2. Perform the procedure outlined above.
3. We are done.
